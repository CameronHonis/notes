does the memory that compiled dyn libs occupy get copied to the process space on process init?

## CodeCompanion (OpenAI Compatible)

Yes, when a program using a dynamic linked library (DLL) is initialized, the operating system does load the library into memory and map it into the process's address space. However, rather than copying the entire DLL contents, the operating system creates references to the shared code and data in memory. 

This allows multiple processes to share the same library code without duplicating it in each process's memory space, which helps conserve memory.

If you have more questions about dynamic libraries or their memory management, feel free to ask!

this would be analogous to how symlink files exist to remap to other file paths, correct?

## CodeCompanion (OpenAI Compatible)

Yes, that's a good analogy. Just as symbolic links (symlinks) act as pointers to other files or directories without duplicating the actual data, dynamic linked libraries (DLLs) allow multiple processes to reference the same loaded library code without needing to copy it into each process's memory space. Both mechanisms provide a form of indirection, enabling shared access and reducing redundancy.
