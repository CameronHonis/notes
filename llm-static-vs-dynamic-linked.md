<user_prompt>static vs dynamic linked library</user_prompt>

## CodeCompanion (OpenAI Compatible)

To explain the difference between static and dynamic linked libraries, here's a step-by-step overview:

1. **Definition**:
   - **Static Linked Library**: A collection of object files which are linked into a program during the compile time. The code becomes part of the executable, and the library is not needed at runtime.
   - **Dynamic Linked Library**: A library that is linked into a program at runtime. The code is not included in the executable; instead, references to it are made, and the actual library file is loaded as needed.

2. **Size of Executable**:
   - Static libraries increase the size of the executable since all the library code is included.
   - Dynamic libraries keep the executable smaller since they reference shared code.

3. **Updates**:
   - Static linked libraries require recompilation of the program to update the library code.
   - Dynamic linked libraries can be updated independently of the executable, allowing easier maintenance and updates.

4. **Memory Usage**:
   - Each executable using a static library has its own copy of the library code, leading to higher memory usage.
   - Dynamic libraries allow multiple executables to share the same library code in memory, reducing overall memory usage.

5. **Platform Dependency**:
   - Static libraries tend to be portable as long as the library is supported on the target platform.
   - Dynamic libraries can be platform-dependent due to different linking and loading mechanisms.

Next, you might want to ask about how to create either type of library or examples of their usage in specific programming languages.

## Me

are dynamic linked libraries expected to already be compiled?

## CodeCompanion (OpenAI Compatible)

Yes, dynamic linked libraries (DLLs) are expected to be pre-compiled. They are shared binary files that contain compiled code ready to be linked at runtime. The application that utilizes a DLL does not need to compile the library; it simply links against the already compiled library file. 

If you have more questions about working with DLLs or any specific programming contexts, feel free to ask!

## Me

and static libraries are always compiled from source code, correct?

## CodeCompanion (OpenAI Compatible)

Yes, static libraries are always compiled from source code. The process involves compiling the source files into object files and then archiving them into a single static library file (often with the extension `.a` or `.lib`). The resulting library contains machine code that is linked into the executable at compile time.

If you need further assistance with static libraries, such as how to create one or examples in a specific language, just let me know!

## Me

bad question, I mean, at compile-time of the consumer, does this also trigger
the static libs to be compiled from their source, as a cascade effect?

## CodeCompanion (OpenAI Compatible)

No, the consumerâ€™s compile-time does not trigger the static libraries to be compiled from their source code. The static libraries must be pre-compiled beforehand. When you compile an application that uses a static library, the compiler links against the already compiled library file. If the static library has been updated and you need those changes, you must manually recompile the static library first before recompiling the consumer application.

If you have further questions about the compilation process or libraries, feel free to ask!
