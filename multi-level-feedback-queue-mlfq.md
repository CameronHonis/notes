a **multi-level feedback queue** is a job scheduling algorithm that balances 
minimizing both response time and turnaround time. it utilizes the concept of 
levels of queues, where the level represents the priority to the scheduler. it 
uses heuristics derived from the history of the jobs to determine placement in 
these levels.
