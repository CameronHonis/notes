# Test

this is a test

in this test, I want to reference another test file [[test2.md]]

I also want to test linking to a note with a dash in the file name [[test-dash.md]]

and lets get really frisky and link to a note with a space in the file name [[test space.md]]
* this one only works by selecting the whole text block inside the double ['s, unfortunately
